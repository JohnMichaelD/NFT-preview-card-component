## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

From this quick project, I was able to practice my HTML and CSS skills and create an NFT card from a design. 

This was my first time adding a hover to an image, and had some complexities when needing to add an image to the image hover, as well as centering it. I also had some issues with the deployment actually showing the hover. 


### Continued development

This was a great way to knock out a quick project and practice my skills. I would like to keep practicing with FlexBox, Grid, and begin using frameworks for future projects like SASS, and also begin introducing JS.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools - Image Hover](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_css_image_overlay_fade) - This helped me get the start on the hover for the image.
